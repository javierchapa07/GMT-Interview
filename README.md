**Text Brush - App for GMT Interview**

*When in home screen you have 4 buttons in the corners*
- Top Left / Undo button, it goes back to previous state, removing most recently added text or loaded image
- Top Right / Edit button, this starts the brush process, it changes the buttons for editing purposes
- Bottom Left / Load button, it lets you load an image from your gallery
- Bottom Right / Save button, it saves the current image to your gallery with the changes made

*When in edit state, you have 4 different buttons in the corners too*
- Top Left / Cancel button, it cancels the edition and removes any unconfirmed changes, you need to click edit button again
- Top Right / Send button, it confirms the changes and writes the text into the image, you can delete them with the undo button
- Bottom Left / Eye button, it opens a modal that lets you change the color of the text, you can see your current color as the icon background
- Bottom Right / Upload button, it lets you change the size of the text with a seekbar, you can see the current size over it

*Important Notes*
- The loaded image needs to be smaller then the screen so the pixels can match, pending enhancement to apply there
- The icons tint changes dynamically depending on the opposite average color of the loaded picture
- When editing you can draw a line in the image, it will show the keyboard for you to write your message
- The line will be smoothed while you draw, that way we dont have sharp turns and it looks bad
- You can click anywhere to close the keyboard or the confirm button inside the same keyboard
- You can click again in the image to show the keyboard again and edit the text
- While typing the text you will be able to see the line and the cursor will show where the next letters will be written
- You will see line where you are typing while editing, once confirming the line will disappear

\***The app is not optimized due to lack of time, I strongly recommend to install the release .apk published here instead of running it on an emulator**
